With over 2 years of hands-on experience in iOS app development and UI/UX design, I specialize in Swift, SwiftUI, MVVM, and Firebase BaaS. After earning First-Class Honours (BSc) in Software Engineering during the challenging times of the coronavirus pandemic, I’ve spent my journey creating unique app ideas, mastering Swift programming, and refining best practices in coding and version control. Drawn to iOS development by the intuitive Xcode IDE, Swift's readable syntax, and Swift's real-time, declarative power of SwiftUI, I pursued this field with a passion for innovation. While my 'Sleepi' app was successfully launched on the App Store, other ambitious projects remain in development due to their complexity. Though I initially encountered challenges with code quality, I’ve grown significantly, now leveraging advanced technologies, protocols, and best practices to build scalable, user-centric applications.
